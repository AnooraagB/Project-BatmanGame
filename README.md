# Batman Game

Welcome to “**Batman Game**”, a text-based adventure game I created during a **Java course** in my undergraduate studies, where you play as Batman and defend Gotham City from iconic villains like the Joker, Bane, Riddler, and Penguin. As the Dark Knight, you will fight the enemies, manage health potions, and face the challenge of surviving in the infamous and unpredictable city of Gotham.

## Features

* Fight against classic Batman villains.
* Use health potions to restore your health or take risks with limited resources.
* Choose between attacking, using health potions, running, or quitting at any time.
* Each battle features different villains, with varying health and attack damage, keeping the gameplay fresh.
* Choose actions using easy-to-follow commands.

## Programming language used

* Java

## Concepts used

* **Control Flow**: Utilizes `if-else` statements to handle user input and game decisions.
* **User Input**: Uses the `Scanner` class to capture player choices and drive game actions.
* **Arrays**: Stores enemy names in an array for random selection during battles.
* **Randomization**: Uses the `Random` class for enemy health, attack damage, and potion drops.
* **Loops**: Implements `while` loops to keep the game running and manage combat.
* **Game State Management**: Tracks player health, enemy stats, and potion count throughout the game.
* **Game Flow**: Manages the overall progression of the game through conditional logic and loops.

## How to play

* **Attack**: Use your combat skills to deal damage to the enemy.
* **Health Potions**: Restore your health when things get tough by using your remaining health potions.
* **Run**: Escape a fight if the odds are against you.
* **Quit**: Exit Gotham City at any point with the q command.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure to have Java(Java 8 or higher) and JDK installed in your system.
3. Open the .java file in your favourite IDE or text editor.
4. Compile and run the programme.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to start playing.
   
## Future plans

* Convert the terminal based design into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for more interactive gameplay.
* Introduce additional game mechanics like special abilities or weapons.
* Suggestions for enhancements and comments on the project are much appreciated.
